# ERDC Python for Data Analysis Tutorial

## Abstract

During the course of this workshop, we will cover a broad set of data 
science how-toâ€™s using Python and several popular industry-standard 
open source libraries, including jupyter notebook, numpy, matplotlib, 
pandas and scikit-learn. We will use several real world datasets to do
read in data, exploratory data analysis, some data cleansing, and 
visualization, and finally build a predictive model using a robust 
cross-validation framework. The material presented is intended for 
those new to data analysis, and only assumes no familiarity with Python.
The workshop will involve hands on coding throughout each session.
